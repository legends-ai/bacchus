#+TITLE: Bacchus project roadmap

* Roadmap
There are a number of things I want to implement eventually in Bacchus that do not currently exist.

** Hold summoner set state externally
We currently use a large in-memory set to track which summoners have not yet been processed. This could work better as a Redis set or some sort of persistent data structure. This will allow us to restart the tool in the middle of scraping and prevent a lot of redundant requests.

** Allow retries
We do not have a retry mechanism in place. We should use something like exponential backoff. This compromises the validity of our data, as we can be missing random pieces of data.
